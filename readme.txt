## Using the Code 
## ====================================

(1) Run 'clust_hex.py'
(2) Run 'clust_hex2.py'
(3) Open Main5.py
(4) Input necessary parameters which are:
	(a) current time, in seconds (time now in code). 12 am refers to 0 seconds
	(b) prediction time, in seconds (analysistime in code)
	(c) day (day in code)
	(d) Weather —-> Provide current weather only
	(e) Month (month in code)

(5) These parameters are available under the comment “Changeable parameters”
(6) After inputting the necessary parameters, run the program. The output, i.e., hexagon locations and their probabilities, for every cluster type are printed to the console.

Note: If Hex location probabilities is not printed, then data corresponding to incidents to learn the probabilities at the set parameters are not available in the dataset"
